    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a 19 year old computer scientist to-be currently on my first year towards a BSc at the University of Edinburgh.
        <br><br>
        I'm a big fan of most types of music and have played the guitar in a variety of amature bands, ranging from death metal to popish indie rock. Currently listening to: Foxing, TRASH.
        <br><br>
        I strongly believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2">Battlefield 2</a> is the best video game ever made (possibly tied with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>).
        <br><br> 
        Unlike many others in the field, I got into programming quite late — my journey began when I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a> in late 2013 — and therefore I won't claim to be the most experienced coder around. I am however hard working, ambitious, and a fast learner. Whatever it is that I do, I always strive to do it better. 
        <br><br>
        Originally from a small town in Sweden, I relocated to the UK in the fall of 2016 to pursue my dreams abroad.

    <p> Though my studies and personal life have got me on my toes right now, I am currently playing around with my first Arduino starter kit. Getting a better grasp of Electrical Engineering has been a goal of mine for some time now, and Arduino seemed like the perfect way to go about it! </p>
