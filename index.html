    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a computer scientist to-be currently on my <strike>first</strike> year towards a BSc at the University of Edinburgh.
        <br><br>
        I am hard working, ambitious, and a fast learner. Whatever it is that I do, I always strive to do it better. 
        <br><br>
        Being a big fan of most types of music I have played the guitar in a variety of amature bands, ranging from death metal to popish indie rock. Currently listening to: Whatever Spotify recommends to me.
        <br><br>
        I strongly believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2" target="_blank">Battlefield 2</a> is the best video game ever made (possibly tied with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee" target="_blank">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>).
        <br><br> 
        Originally from a small town in Sweden, I relocated to the UK in the fall of 2016 to pursue my dreams abroad.

    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a computer scientist to-be currently on my first (soon second!) year towards a BSc at the University of Edinburgh.
        <br><br>
        I am hard working, ambitious, and a fast learner. Whatever it is that I do, I always strive to do it better.

    <h2> Programming Language Experience </h2>
    <p>  I won't claim to be the most experienced coder around. I have, however, worked with the following languages (roughly from most to least familiar):
    <ul>
      <li> Java: I first gained basic familiarity with Java when I took a course on it in High School, and later got the opportunity to expand on this knowledge in the university course <i>Informatics 1: Object Oriented Programming</i> that I took last semester. That being said, most of what I know I have since learnt from doing various minor pet projects (see <a href="#projects">Pet Projects &amp; Portfolio</a>), as is often the case with programming!</li>
      <li> Haskell: I know some Haskell from having taken a University course in it last semester. Though the course never really expanded on advanced topics such as monads, it gave me an insight into the functional approach to programming, which I have found to be very useful in many areas. I hope to do more functional programming in the future, and particularly liked Haskell's rigid yet surprisingly flexible type system. Lately I've been going through various problems on the <a href="https://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">Project Euler webpage</a> using Haskell alone.
      <li> C: I gained knowledge of basic C while taking Harvard's course <i>CS50</i> through <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a> over last summer. The course, which was by the way excellent, focused mostly on topics such as input manipulation, creating and storing information in custom data structures (eg. Tries, Trees), and basic debugging techniques (including identifying memory leaks using Valgrind). Though unforgiving, I did thoroughly enjoy working in C &mdash; storing things in memory just isn't the same when you don't have to <i>malloc</i>, and it was most certainly useful to have to make my own implementations of things like doubly linked lists that I normally take for granted in other languages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are some other languages (Python, C++, Javascript, etc.) which I have either taken very basic online courses in or have some minor experience with from helping friends on coursework, but I wouldn't say I am very confident in them.
