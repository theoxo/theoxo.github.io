    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a computer scientist to-be currently on my first year towards a BSc at the University of Edinburgh.
        <br><br>
        I am hard working, ambitious, and a fast learner. Whatever it is that I do, I always strive to do it better. 
        <br><br>
        Being a big fan of most types of music I have played the guitar in a variety of amature bands, ranging from death metal to popish indie rock. Currently listening to: Various UK hip hop.
        <br><br>
        I strongly believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2" target="_blank">Battlefield 2</a> is the best video game ever made (possibly tied with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee" target="_blank">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>).
        <br><br> 
        Originally from a small town in Sweden, I relocated to the UK in the fall of 2016 to pursue my dreams abroad.

    <h2> Programming Language Experience </h2>
    <p>  I won't claim to be the most experienced coder around. I have, however, worked with the following languages (roughly from most to least familiar):
    <ul>
      <li> Java: I first gained basic familiarity with Java when I took a course on it in High School, however I learnt most of what I know when I developed the graphing calculator (see <a href="#projects">Pet Projects &amp; Portfolio</a>). I am also currently taking a course in Java at university, titled "<i>Informatics 1: Object Oriented Programming</i>", in which I hope to solidify my knowledge.</li>
      <li> C: I gained knowledge of basic C while taking Harvard's course <i>CS50</i> through <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a> over last summer. Though unforgiving, I did enjoy working in C (storing things in memory just isn't the same when you don't have to <i>malloc</i>). The course mostly covered basics such as input manipulation and creating and storing information in custom data structures (eg. Tries, Trees).</li>
      <li> Haskell: I know some Haskell from having taken a University course in it last semester. I had never even attempted to use a functional programming language before, so I must say I did thoroughly enjoy the course, although it never really expanded on advanced topics such as monads.
    </ul>
    <p>There are some other languages (Python, C++, Javascript, etc.) which I have either taken very basic online courses in or have some minor experience with from helping friends on coursework, but I wouldn't say I am very confident in them.
    </p>

    <h3> Present </h3>
    <p> Currently busy with revising for exams. Did start working on a <a href="https://github.com/theoxo/8gamesolver" target="_blank">puzzle game solver</a> but do not have the time to finish it right now. I've also been doing some introductory projects with my Arduino, mostly just to get my head around basic electrical engineering. Hopefully once summer rolls around I'll have the time to do something more interesting. </p>
