    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I am a computer scientist to-be currently on my first year towards a BSc at the University of Edinburgh.
        <br><br>
        I am hard working, ambitious, and a fast learner. Whatever it is that I do, I always strive to do it better. 
        <br><br>
        Being a big fan of most types of music I have played the guitar in a variety of amature bands, ranging from death metal to popish indie rock. Currently listening to: Foxing, TRASH.
        <br><br>
        I strongly believe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefield_2" target="_blank">Battlefield 2</a> is the best video game ever made (possibly tied with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee" target="_blank">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>).
        <br><br> 
        Originally from a small town in Sweden, I relocated to the UK in the fall of 2016 to pursue my dreams abroad.

    <h2> Programming Language Experience </h2>
    <p>  I won't claim to be the most experienced coder around. I have, however, worked with the following languages (roughly from most to least familiar):
    <ul>
      <li> Java: I first gained basic familiarity with Java when I took a course on it in High School, however I learnt most of what I know when I developed the graphing calculator (see <a href="#projects">Pet Projects &amp; Portfolio</a>). I am also currently taking a course in Java at university, titled "<i>Informatics 1: Object Oriented Programming</i>", in which I hope to learn how to do things "the right way".</li>
      <li> C: I gained knowledge of basic C while taking Harvard's course <i>CS50</i> through <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a> over last summer. Though unforgiving, I did enjoy working in C (storing things in memory just isn't the same when you don't have to <i>malloc</i>).</li>
      <li> Haskell: I know some Haskell from having taken a course in it last semester. I had never even attempted to use a functional programming language before, so I must say I did thoroughly enjoy the course, although it never really expanded on advanced topics such as monads.
      <li> C++: I have very little knowledge of C++ but hope to learn once my Arduino arrives. </li>
      <li> HTML/CSS: I know enough HTML and CSS to build responsive, light weight websites such as this one. </li>
      <li> Javascript: Though Javascript was the first language I ever coded in (through <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>'s course), I can't say I have a lot of experience in it beyond just basic syntax. </li>
      <li> Python: Basic familiarity with syntax, mostly from having taken <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>'s course but also from having helped friends with coursework (reading/manipulating data from .csv's). </li>
      <li> Ruby: Very little experience but I'm currently trying to squeeze in some Ruby/Rails practice into my schedule in order to learn more web dev.
    </ul>

    <h3> Present </h3>
    <p> I am currently waiting for my first Arduino starter kit to arrive. Getting a better grasp of Electrical Engineering has been a goal of mine for some time now, and Arduino seemed like the perfect way to go about it! I am also trying to get the most out of my courses while spending the little free time I have left over fiddling with Ruby on Rails.</p>
