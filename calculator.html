      <li> November 2015 - March 2016 </li>
      <li> approx. 75+ hours of research and work </li>
    </ul>
    <p> This was my diploma project in my final year of high school <a href="http://www.skolverket.se/skolformer/gymnasieutbildning/gymnasieskola/gymnasiearbetet" target="_blank">(more information on diploma projects in Swedish high schools available here)</a>. Two of my classmates and I set out to create a graphing calculator based off a Raspberry Pi, and I was made solely responsible for creating the software while they worked on the casing. <br><br>
        The entirety of the code was written in Java, with the help of the NetBeans IDE to create the necessary menu structure. In the end the code ended up both  messy and inefficient (and, honestly speaking, ridden with bugs), but I was nonetheless proud to have completed the task as this was not only my first large scale programming project, but also the first time I had created a piece of software from the ground up. <br><br>
        The project taught me a lot about programming, both in Java specifically and in general. I was very much a novice when we started out so I had to learn a lot of the concepts and techniques as I was going, essentially meaning even the smallest of tasks took a lot of brain-storming and effort to figure out. It was both a very demanding and fun process!<br>

    <h2> Finished Product </h2>
    <p> Though we ultimately failed to produce a final product as we did not have the means to create the casing, the software ran successfully on the Raspberry Pi. It wasn't neccessarily very pretty (<i> *cough* </i>) but interacting with it using the touchscreen we connected was as effortless as we had hoped for. <br><br>
        Unfortunately I do not have any pictures of the unit itself, but the following are screengrabs highlighting some parts of the final software:
