Super happy to share that today some of my fellow students and I put up a preprint
on arXiv. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04968">Check it out here!</a>
The paper consists of a thorough comparison of image classification techniques for
memory-constrained devices, which is an interesting field since it has not yet converged
to the same extent that ML more broadly has. For example, nobody in their right mind
would probably even consider using anything other than a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification in general,
but things are not so clear cut when memory footprint is an important factor to consider.

Thanks to Sebastian and John for working with me on this preprint, and to Pavlos for supervising the project!
