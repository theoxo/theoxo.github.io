Last week I finished reading Swedish-American physicist Max Tegmark's book <em>Life 3.0</em>,
which sets out to answer the question that seems to be on everyone's mind lately:
how will advances in artificial intelligence impact the future of humankind?
</p>
<p>
Truth be told my expectations were not very high when I first picked up this book.
Though I had heard of Tegmark before
and knew he was a well-respected physicist and author, I had no idea that he
cared so much about the subject, nor that he in fact is quite involved with the
surronding research community as well.
AI (in particular Machine Learning) has received
widespread attention in the popular press over the past few years, and as
a result of the sheer number of books and arcticles now being written on the
subject a healthy dose of skepticism seems to be in order.
</p>
<p>
Last year I was reading a similar book:
<em>What To Do When Machines Do Everything: How to Get Ahead in a World of AI, Algorithms, Bots, and Big Data</em>
(by B. Pring, M. Frank, and P. Roehrig). Unfortunately, the most interesting
part of this book was its ridiculously long title.
Drawing weak comparisons between
current times and technological revolutions of the past, it seemed to simply
throw its hands into the air, saying "things will be good because they have been
before"; instead of inspiring scientific curiosity and discussion, it struck me
as ultimately promoting carelessness and greed (though it did try its best to hide this
behind tables and figures).
</p>
<p>
Luckily, Life 3.0 is nothing like that book. In fact, it is one of the most
interesting books I've read, and Tegmark really blew me away with how passionate
and knowledgeable he was about the subject. Though the short chapter in the book
which is devoted to discussing the history and future of our Universe reveals
where he feels most confident, the whole book
radiates with a scientific curiosity and wisdom that I haven't
felt since Daniel Kahneman's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">
<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>, while still managing to be a fair bit easier to read
than the latter.
</p>
<p>
In the book, Tegmark manages to discuss everything from how information can
be computed and stored (on a level I think would be accessible to any adult)
to what it means for something to be conscious. He goes out of his way to
describe elaborate future scenarios both utopian and dystopian in nature,
and motivates these by commenting on how even within the top echelon of
artificial intelligence researchers there is great disagreement regarding
what the future may hold. All of this is also backed up by his own personal
beliefs, though he presents these in a way that makes it clear that he
welcomes you to disagree as long as you've given it enough thought.
Finally, he outlines the work him and his colleagues at the
<a href="https://futureoflife.org"><em>Future of Life Institute</em></a> are doing
to promote research that they believe will help ensure life
will continue to strive in our Universe.
</p>
<p>
As you can probably tell by now, I highly recommend you to read this book.
It's very interesting, and though you may or may not be convinced of
Tegmark's own point of view (despite him making a very compelling case), the book
offers a lot of valuable food for thought. If nothing else, I recommend
that you check out the FoL institute's <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">
list of AI principles</a> and then ask yourself what these mean to you. Are
they all bark and no bite? Will they hinder research that could otherwise save countless
lives? Or do they strike a nice balance between the two?
</p>
<p>
Until next time!

Footnote: I am not convinced that "What
To Do When Machines Do Everything" is a bad book. Perhaps it is merely aimed
at a different audience, one which will find Tegmark's unwillingness to
give concrete answers annoying and would prefer a more firm view on the issue.
If you're interested, I strongly encourage you to give it a read and to let
me know what you thought of it, especially if you disagree with me.
