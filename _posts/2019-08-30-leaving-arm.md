<h2> Leaving Arm </h2>
<p>
Today was my last day as a research intern at <a href="https://www.arm.com">Arm</a>.
Though I feel relieved to have finished my work and am looking forward
to going home, leaving a job you have really enjoyed is always bittersweet.
</p>
<p>
At Arm I was a part of the Memory research group, which was quite exciting.
Memory is of course a huge bottleneck in modern computer systems (though we
try our best to hide this!) so it's quite cool to be part of a team addressing
that bottleneck -- especially when your architecture is so widespread that it
was used in <a href="https://community.arm.com/resized-image/__size/790x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-21-42/5554.ARM_5F00_IG_5F00_SetTheStage_5F00_6a_5F00_tiny.jpg">50 billion chips between 2013 and 2017 alone</a>.
It then goes without saying that I really learnt a lot this summer, especially
when it comes to memory models, their verification, and how upcoming
non-volatile memory technologies bring new challenges into the picture.
</p>
<p>
I really want to thank everyone I met and worked with at Arm for making
this summer a very welcoming and fun experience. Despite having such a
big impact on today's world -- with almost everyone walking around with
an Arm-based CPU in their pocket -- Arm has a very calm and approachable
atmosphere, a culture which I hope they manage to retain as they continue
to expand in the future. Finally, I am thankful that I got to work on a real,
"on the critical path" research project (rather than just carrying out
data collection or engineering work), and that I was able to work so closely
with my supervisor, Nikos Nikoleris.
</p>
<p>
Until next time!
