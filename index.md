<p> Hi!
    I'm Theo Olausson, a 4th year Informatics student at the University of Edinburgh.
    This summer I've had the pleasure of being a research intern at <a href="https://www.arm.com">Arm</a>,
    and I have previously spent time as a research intern at my university.
</p>
<p>
    What I enjoy the most in life is solving difficult problems, especially
    if I need to learn some new skills along the way. Historically I've worked
    a lot on Computer Architecture, though I have more recently turned my gaze
    towards Machine Learning due to being a strong advocate for the <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">Beneficial AI</a>
    movement.
</p>
<p>
    If you'd like to have a peek at some of the stuff I've focused my interest
    on in the past, feel free to check out my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. You
    can also view my <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>, check out some
    of my software projects on <a href="https://github.com/theoxo">GitHub</a>, or
    connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-olausson/">LinkedIn</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In my free time I play the guitar and occasionally shoot 35mm film photos. I'm also
    very passionate about the environment and ensuring that technology is used
    to improve the wellbeing of all.
