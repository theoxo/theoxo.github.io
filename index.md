<p> Hi!
    I'm Theo Olausson, a 3rd year Informatics student at the University of Edinburgh.
    <br><br>
    My main interests lie in computer architecture, AI/ML, and maths.
    <br><br>
    In my free time I play the guitar and shoot 35mm film photos. I'm also
    very passionate about the environment and ensuring that technology is used
    to improve the wellbeing of all.
