<p> Hi!
    I'm Theo Olausson, a 4th year Informatics student at the University of Edinburgh.
    Currently I'm a research intern at Arm, and I also spent last summer as
    a research intern within the School of Informatics at my university.
    <br><br>
    My main interests lie in AI, ML, and computer architecture.
    Recently I decided to start a <a href="/blog">blog</a>, where I hope to
    write about these topics.
    <br><br>
    In my free time I play the guitar and occasionally shoot 35mm film photos. I'm also
    very passionate about the environment and ensuring that technology is used
    to improve the wellbeing of all.
    <br><br>
