<p> Hi!
    My name is <mark>Theo Olausson</mark> and I'm a 3rd year Informatics student at the University of Edinburgh.
    <br><br>
    I'm interested in computer architecture, natural language processing, and
    many other aspects of computer science.
    <br><br>
    In my free time I play the guitar. I'm also
    very passionate about the environment and ensuring that technology is used
    to improve the wellbeing of all.
