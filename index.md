<p> Hi!
    I'm Theo Olausson, a 4th year Informatics student at the University of Edinburgh.
    This summer I've had the pleasure of being a research intern at <a href="https://www.arm.com">Arm</a>,
    and I have previously spent time as a research intern at my university.
</p>
<p>
    What I enjoy the most in life is solving difficult problems, especially
    if I need to learn some new skills along the way. Historically I've worked
    a lot on Computer Architecture, though I am also very interested in
    Machine Learning.
</p>
<p>
    Recently I've decided to start a <a href="/blog">blog</a>, where I hope to
    write about systems, machine learning, and other things I find interesting.
    If you want to find out more about me, you can also view my
    <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>, check out some
    of my software projects on <a href="https://github.com/theoxo">GitHub</a>, or
    connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-olausson/">LinkedIn</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In my free time I play the guitar and occasionally shoot 35mm film photos. I'm also
    very passionate about the environment and ensuring that technology is used
    to improve the wellbeing of all, and support various organisations and charities
    that I believe will help guide society down this path, such as the
    <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">Beneficial AI</a> movement.
