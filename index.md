<p> Hi!
    I'm Theo Olausson, a 4th year Informatics student at the
    <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics">University of Edinburgh</a>.
    I'm interested in computer architecture
    (specifically ensuring correctness of memory and caches
    during program execution), machine learning, and maths more generally.
</p>
<p>
    What I enjoy the most in life is solving difficult problems, especially
    if I need to learn some new skills along the way.
    I consider myself lucky to have had the pleasure of being a research intern
    at <a href="https://www.arm.com">Arm</a> this summer,
    and to also have spent time as a research assistant at my university before.
    I hope to continue carrying out research in the future.
</p>
<p>
    Recently I've decided to start a <a href="/blog">blog</a>, where I will
    write about systems, machine learning, and other things I find interesting.
    If you want to find out more about me, you can also view my
    <a href="/assets/resume.pdf">resume</a>, check out some
    of my software projects on <a href="https://github.com/theoxo">GitHub</a>, or
    connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/theo-olausson/">LinkedIn</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In my free time I play the guitar and occasionally shoot 35mm film photos. I'm
    very passionate about the environment and ensuring that technology is used
    to improve the wellbeing of all, and support various organisations and charities
    that I believe will help guide society down this path, such as the
    <a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">Beneficial AI</a> movement.
